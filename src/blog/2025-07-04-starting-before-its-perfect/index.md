description: "Overcoming analysis paralysis and finally launching my personal website after three years of planning - lessons on perfectionism and the value of just starting"

More than 3 years ago I bought my first domain, with the main goal of building my own website. I have always liked the idea of having a place of total ownership over what I can do, just to share things, experiment and learn about the web.

Another big reason for me was having control over my email. There are way too many horror stories of people losing access to almost all of their digital life because their account was incorrectly banned. And no, if you use Gmail (or basically any other email service with users in the hundred of millions), there's no way of contacting a real human being for help in case that happens to you. Your account can just be deactivated one day without explanation.

I did set up the email on my own domain when I bought it, but why did it take so long for my website? Honestly, I have a problem of postponing projects indefinitely even though I had more than enough time to put this simple site online. However, in my defense, there was one mayor reason, and it was [**paralysis by analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis).

See, I have a problem of overanalysing everything, and in this case I wanted to have the perfect setup for my website. I wanted to make sure I was choosing the right technologies, the right framework, having the perfect workflow from the beginning, choosing the right hosting service. I've spent countless hours looking at other people's personal websites in search of inspiration, and many more hours researching static site generators (SSG), in the quest of finding the *"best"* one.

Of course, perfection doesn't exist, every time I sat down to work on it, I didn't accomplish anything because:

1) I wanted to have the perfect everything from the beginning. In my mind, I didn't want to regret my choice of X at some point and then have to rebuild my website.
2) I got overwhelmed with the amount of information you can find online about creating a personal website.

After a couple of years with this project in the back of my mind the entire time, I finally had a change in perspective, especially after reading the amazing article [*Into the Personal-Website-Verse*](https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse) by Matthias Ott, which I highly recommend, I absolutely loved that article.

> The personal website. It’s a place to write, create, and share whatever you like, without the need to ask for anyone’s permission. It is also the perfect place to explore and try new things ...
> It is totally up to you what you create and because you have unlimited shots on the Web, you can try out different formats, different styles, different topics. Regardless of what other people might think and although it might not work. Creation is free.

I realized that I didn't need to choose the *"perfect"* set of technologies to start my website, that's not the point, the point is to make mistakes, experiment and most importantly, learn along the journey. No need to overthink or try to optimize everything, because as Matthias points out, you have unlimited shots.

> Personal sites, our blogs, these were once our playgrounds. My own site was the first place I added rollover images, CSS for fonts, tried out a “table free” design. I wrote about the web, surrounded by my own experiments with the web.

I went with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) as my SSG of choice. I really wanted to go the "minimalist" way and use something like [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) for generating the HTML from markdown, and that's it, nothing else, but for the time being, I've decided to make my life simpler by using an SSG that comes with a lot of useful features.

With all of that said, and taking inspiration from what I read in [*Into the Personal-Website-Verse*](https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse), I'll publish the most basic version of my personal website, and then document the process of improving it, making mistakes and learning new things. 

Here's a list of articles that (along with the one by Matthias I mentioned earlier) helped shift my perspective and finally pushed me to start my website.
